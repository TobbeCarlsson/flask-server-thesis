# README

This is the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) [quick start](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/#a-minimal-application) example for [Render](https://render.com).

The app in this repo is deployed at [https://flask.onrender.com](https://flask.onrender.com).

## Deployment

Follow the guide at https://render.com/docs/deploy-flask.

## Notes

- When the server is running, you can run the upload_initial_behaviors.py script to upload some initial behaviors to the server. Remember to change the UPLOAD_URL inside the script to the correct url for the server.
- If you want to modify the initial behaviors you can modify the initial_behaviors.json file
- If you have a profile on the server that you want to remove you can run the delete_profile script. Remember once again to update the correct url.
